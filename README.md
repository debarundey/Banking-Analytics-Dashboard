# 🏦 Banking Analytics Dashboard

## 📌 Problem Statement

The aim of this project is to build a basic understanding of risk analytics in the banking and financial services industry, and to show how data can be used to minimize the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

## ✅ Solution Overview

This Power BI dashboard provides meaningful insights to help banks make better lending decisions based on an applicant’s profile. It predicts whether the applicant is likely to repay the loan, thereby supporting risk minimization.

## 🧪 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Before building the dashboard, exploratory data analysis was performed using **Google Colab**. This helped in:

- Understanding the structure and relationships within the dataset  
- Identifying missing values and data quality issues  
- Extracting early insights  
- Defining key metrics and segments to visualize later in Power BI

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

- Created new columns and new measures using DAX.
- Extracted the years from Joined Bank column.

## 📊 Key Metrics (KPIs)

The dashboard provides visibility into critical banking metrics such as:

- Total Clients  
- Total Loans  
- Total Deposits  
- Bank Loan  
- Business Lending  
- Credit Card Balance  
- Savings and Checking Accounts  
- Foreign Currency Accounts  
- Total Fees  
- Client Engagement  

These metrics help assess customer behavior, product adoption, risk exposure, and business performance.

## 📈 Visualizations & Dashboard Layout

The Power BI report includes the following views:

- **Home Page** – Quick overview of the banking operations  
- **Loan Analysis** – Deep dive into lending patterns and risk levels  
- **Deposit Analysis** – Visual breakdown of various deposit types  
- **Summary Dashboard** – Aggregate view of all KPIs and insights  

## 🔍 Insights & Observations

- Identify which type of banks (private vs. public) attract more clients.
- Understand client engagement duration and its relation to loan performance.
- Compare bank loans by customer nationality.
- Assess how income bands correlate with credit and deposit patterns.

## 🔮 Future Scope

- Add predictive analytics for default risk.
- Incorporate churn probability models.
- Enable client segmentation based on engagement and product usage.
- Benchmark performance across branches or time periods.
